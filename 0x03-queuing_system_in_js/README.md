# REDIS

Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis cache delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT.

Redis is a great database for use with Node. Both Redis and Node share similar type conventions and threading models, which makes for a very predictable development experience. By pairing Node and Redis together you can achieve a scalable and productive development platform.

Redis has two primary Node clients which are node-redis and ioredis. Both are available through npm. We generally suggest using node-redis, as it has wide support for Redis modules, is easily extended, and is widely used.
